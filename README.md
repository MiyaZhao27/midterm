# Midterm Assignment

This repo contains the two files needed to complete the midterm assignment, the .qmd file and the .csv file. Please review the following instructions carefully.

## Submission Instructions

This assignment is due **Wednesday 23rd of July 2025 at 9am**:

- Please submit this assignment via the submission portal on Moodle.

- Please submit your assignment as both a knitted .html file and the corresponding .qmd file; PDFs or other formats will not be accepted. You must name the files accordingly: "ME314_midterm_XXXXXXXXX" where XXXXXXXXX should be replaced with your LSE candidate number. The candidate number is your LSE ID number (not your Library number). 

- We will assess your assignment based on how well you apply the methods and reasoning introduced during our lectures and seminar sessions.

*Please note, we will not contact you to recompile documents if they are submitted in the wrong format. It is your responsibility to ensure you submit your work correctly. Failure to do so will result in a mark of 0 for that assignment.*

*You are expected to complete this problem set yourself without excessive use of generative AI. You should use sample code from seminars and lectures, and adapt it to the questions below on your own. You may consult generative AI to answer general questions and/or supplement your learning, but not to complete the exercises. Markers have lots of experience reviewing student work, and they can usually tell when generative AI substantially completed an assignment. If we suspect you have done this, we will mark your answers accordingly.*
  
## Introduction

This is a *summative* assignment, and will constitute 25% of your final grade. You should use feedback from seminars to ensure you meet both the substantive and formatting standards for this module.

For clarity, the formatting requirements for this assignment are:

- Unless otherwise stated, you must present all results in full sentences, as you would in a report or academic piece of writing. Keep it as concise as possible!

- If the exercise requires generating a table or figure, you should include at least one sentence introducing and explaining it. E.g. "The table below reports the counts of Wikipedia articles mentioning the LSE, by type of article."

- Unless stated otherwise, all code used to answer the exercises should be included in the code chunks for each exercise. 

- All code should be annotated with comments, to help the marker understand what you have done.

- Your output should be replicable and results should be reproducible. Any result/table/figure that cannot be traced back to your code will not be marked.
